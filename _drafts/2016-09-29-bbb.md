Object and array literals allow us to leave a dangling comma since third version of ECMAScript (IE8 and below as an clear exception). Other programming languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, C#, Swift, D, Hack and probably many more) allow it in functions as well. JavaScript implementation is coming! [Jeff Morrison](https://twitter.com/lbljeffmo) is an author of [Trailing Commas in Function Param Lists](https://jeffmo.github.io/es-trailing-function-commas/) proposal that is going to be merged with upcoming ECMAScript 2017 spec. If you don't know what the heck am I talking about have a look at this basic examples.

```js
// Array without trailing comma
const someArray = [
  'pawel',
  29
];

// Array with trailing comma
const someArray = [
  'pawel',
  29,
];
```

```js
// Object without trailing comma
const someObject = [
  name: 'pawel',
  age: 29
];

// Object with trailing comma
const someObject = [
  name: 'pawel',
  age: 29,
];
```

```js
// Function declaration without trailing comma
function someFunction(
  name,
  age
) {...}

// Function declaration with trailing comma
function someFunction(
  name,
  age,
) {...}
```

```js
// Function invocation without trailing comma
someFunction(
  'pawel',
  29
);

// Function invocation with trailing comma
someFunction(
  'pawel',
  29,
);
```

This blog is not one of those stylistic dilemmas like "semicolon or die". In my opinion it is 100% personal preference. Let's talk a bit about the benefits of the new feature and how to deal with it now.

## Nice VCS diff and easier code manipulations

New feature won't supercharge the output of your app whatsoever but can definitely benefit codebase [manipulation and maintainability](https://medium.com/@nikgraf/why-you-should-enforce-dangling-commas-for-multiline-statements-d034c98e36f8).

1. Nice git diffs
2. Easier code rearranging
3. Programmatically generate code without extra logic for last item

## Babel to use, ESLint to check

Babel is a great time capsule that allows you to use syntax of the future today. [Babel-preset-es2017](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2017/) is something definitely worth to include in your `.babelrc` file. As an another confirmed future that is coming with ES2017 â€” async functions support comes with this preset too.

```bash
# install the cli and this preset
npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-es2017

# make a .babelrc (config file) with the preset
echo '{ "presets": ["es2017"] }' > .babelrc
```
