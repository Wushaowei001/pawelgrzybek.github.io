A really small trick with CSS `:target` pseudo_element by [Ire Aderinokun](https://twitter.com/ireaderinokun). You may not need JavaScript if you know CSS well. Probably it is not very accessibility friendly and not the best supported solution ever, but it is still very cool!

[http://jsrocks.org/2015/01/temporal-dead-zone-tdz-demystified/](http://jsrocks.org/2015/01/temporal-dead-zone-tdz-demystified/)

This term is floating around on twitter for some time. Initially I knew that it must be something related with new behaviour of let and const hoisting. Kind of right, but there is so many details that all js divs needs to be aware of. [UltCombo](https://twitter.com/Ult_Combo) explains it really well!

## The Search For The Holy Grail: How I Ended Up With Element Queries, And How You Can Use Them Today

[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/how-i-ended-up-with-element-queries-and-how-you-can-use-them-today/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/how-i-ended-up-with-element-queries-and-how-you-can-use-them-today/)

The founder of CSS Element Queries Tommy Hodgins introduces a concept of his project. It is a thing that developers has been waiting for since media-queries got a first adoption few years ago. Let me quote an author what kind of a problem that EQCSS solves.

> But when designing plugins and interfaces with element queries, we can easily write responsive styles that cover all of the situations we anticipate, making them truly bulletproof, no matter what content the user puts inside or where the plugin shows up. Suppose we could style a widget with layouts ranging from 150 to 2000 pixels wide. Then, no matter where that widget is displayed on a website, it would always look great.
