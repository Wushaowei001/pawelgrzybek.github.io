Web developer's learning curve is endless and the main source of information are blogs created by other developers. Vast majority of authors highlight the benefits of written content whenever they share some thoughts about their career path. I have never understood that before I tried by myself. Exactlly one year ago I published my first article on this website and I can't be happier that I started.

TLTR: Make a blog, write one, publish one - now!

## Not so boring stats

- Year of blogging costed me £6 (price of a beer)
- I earn on blogging £0
- No boring stats, I removed GA to spend some more time on content instead of comparing meaningless numbers
- 37 posts (one per 10 days), I’m happy with the score because i have a full time job, run a small business with friend who lives 2000km away, care about my lovely cat and went through split with my girlfriend after 4 years relationship

## Technical look at the blogging

- platform doesn’t matter, pick one that you comfortable with
- Jekyll great choice, removes complexity and allows you to be focused on blogging
- Github for hosting is free, amazingly fast and beautifully work with Jekyll based projects

## What went well

- Learned so much
- Every article requires a solid preparation
- People share my articles on twitter and different channels
- Some people that I follow and treat as a authorities shared my blog posts
- Some of them even follow me on Twitter, wawawiwa!
- Some of my articles has beed send around in great newsletters by Rachel Andrew and Alsen Hannemann

## What are my future plans

- blog more
- learn more
- share more
- The most important, high fun and motivation to do more and more and constantly be involved in progress of our amazing web community
