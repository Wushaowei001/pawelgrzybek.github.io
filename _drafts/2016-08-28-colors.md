- intro
- - always use css colors
- - majority familiar with colors from css1 and css2
- - tons of new stuff is coming but now its just a draft
- - can be applied to any element
- - inherited property
- - color space used on computer screens is sRGB - a triplet of values — red, green, and blue, internationally-recognized and device-independent
- - several methods of directly specifying a color
- - -<rgb()>
- - -<rgba()>
- - -<hsl()>
- - -<hsla()>
- - -<hwb()>
- - -<gray()>
- - -<device-cmyk()>
- - -<color-mod()> |
- - -<hex-color>
- - -<named-color>
- - -currentcolor |
- - -<deprecated-system-color>

- rgb
- - colors can be presented as a percentage value (0-100%) or numeric (0-255)
- - graphics engines store the color channels internally as a single byte, which can hold integers between 0 and 255
- - values outside these ranges are not invalid, but are clamped to the ranges defined here at computed-value time
- - recently depreciated rgba() color function, replaced by simply rgb()
- - For legacy reasons, rgb() also supports an alternate syntax that separates all of its arguments with commas
- - Also for legacy reasons, an rgba() function also exists, with an identical grammar and behavior to rgb()
- - examples
- - - rgb(255, 255, 255 / .5)
- - - rgb(100%, 100%, 100% / .5)
- - - rgb(30%, 30%, 30% / 70%)
- - - rgb(30%, 30%, 30% / 70%)
- - - old: rgb(255, 255, 255, .5)
- - - old: rgba(30%, 30%, 30%, 70%)
- - browser support for new syntax, and for how long the old one is going to be supported
- - link tab atkins article here about the decision of changing a notation

- hex color
- - the most popular notation of colors written directly in computer code
- - supported by all graphic editing tools as far as I know
- - specified by giving the channels as hexadecimal numbers
- - hash character, "#", followed by 3, 4, 6 or 8 digits 0-9 or characters a-f (characters are case-insensitive)
- - 00 represents the minimum and ff (255 in decimal) maximum value
- - link the video to hexadecimal numbers on YouTube
- - 6 digits notation is set of 3 pairs of hexadecimal values (red, green, blue)
- - 8 digits notation is set of 4 pairs of hexadecimal values (red, green, blue, alpha)
- - 3 and 4 digit notation is identical to a 6 and 8 digit notation obtained by "duplicating" all of the digits
- - browser support for 3 and 6 dig notation since forever, but alpha channel in hex notation is supported in...

- named-colors
- - CSS defines a large set of named colors
- - case-insensitive
- - 16 of CSS’s named colors come from HTML originally: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow. Most of the rest come from one version of the X11 color system, used in Unix-derived systems to specify colors for the console
- - For historical reasons, this is also referred to as the X11 color set.
- - names are full of weirdness and inconsistency. For example darkgray is lighter than gray or lightpink is darker than pink. If you fancy to explore more messy examples that occured in this standard i encourage you to watch [Alex Sexton: Peachpuffs and Lemonchiffons](https://youtu.be/HmStJQzclHc)
