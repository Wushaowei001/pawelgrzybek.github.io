- intro
- - always use css colors
- - majority familiar with colors from css1 and css2
- - tons of new stuff is coming but now its just a draft
- - can be applied to any element
- - inherited property
- - color space used on computer screens is sRGB - a triplet of values â€” red, green, and blue, internationally-recognized and device-independent
- - several methods of directly specifying a color
- - -<rgb()>
- - -<rgba()>
- - -<hsl()>
- - -<hsla()>
- - -<hwb()>
- - -<gray()>
- - -<device-cmyk()>
- - -<color-mod()> |
- - -<hex-color>
- - -<named-color>
- - -currentcolor |
- - -<deprecated-system-color>

- rgb
- - colors can be presented as a presentage value (0-100%) or numeric (0-255)
- - graphics engines store the color channels internally as a single byte, which can hold integers between 0 and 255
- - values outside these ranges are not invalid, but are clamped to the ranges defined here at computed-value time
- - recently depreciated rgba() color function, replaced by simply rgb()
- - For legacy reasons, rgb() also supports an alternate syntax that separates all of its arguments with commas
- - Also for legacy reasons, an rgba() function also exists, with an identical grammar and behavior to rgb()
- - examples
- - - rgb(255, 255, 255 / .5)
- - - rgb(100%, 100%, 100% / .5)
- - - rgb(30%, 30%, 30% / 70%)
- - - rgb(30%, 30%, 30% / 70%)
- - - old: rgb(255, 255, 255, .5)
- - - old: rgba(30%, 30%, 30%, 70%)
- - browser support for new syntax, and for how long the old one is going to be supported
- - link tab atkins article here about the decision of changing a notation

- hex color
- - specified by giving the channels as hexadecimal numbers, which is similar to how colors are often written directly in computer code
- -  <hash-token> token whose value consists of 3, 4, 6, or 8 hexadecimal digits
- - hash character, "#", followed by some number of digits 0-9 or letters a-f (characters are not case sensitive)
- - 00 represents the minimum value and ff (255 in decimal) maximum
- - link the video to hexademical numbers on youtube
- - 3 and 6 digits notation - red, green, blue
- - 4 and 8 digits notation - red, green, blue, alpha
