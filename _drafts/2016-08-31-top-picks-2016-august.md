## David Wells - CSS in React

A great talk by [David Wells](https://twitter.com/DavidWells) on ReactJS San Francisco Bay Area meet-up. All that you need to know about styling React components. Pros and cons of each popular method with strong recommendation of [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) powered by [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/). I don't entirely agree with some parts of David's approach but it is really interesting to have an overview of other developers strategy.

Tab Atkins explains the reason behind new syntax for CSS rgb color notation. If it's too long too read the only thing to remember is future in the future `rgba(0, 255, 0, 50%)` notation will be replaced by `rgb(0 255 0 / 50%)`. The reason behind it makes sense.

Next one from CSS Tricks this week. Chris Coyier presents a neat trick to select a whole block of text via single click without heavy JavaScript of Flash based add-ons. Very handy trick especially when we need to make sure that whole bit of code is copies (like a code snippet or telephone number).

## Yes, You Should Learn Vanilla JavaScript Before Fancy JS Frameworks

[https://snipcart.com/blog/learn-vanilla-javascript-before-using-js-frameworks](https://snipcart.com/blog/learn-vanilla-javascript-before-using-js-frameworks)

I can't agree enough with this article. I'm sick of people who call themselves "Angular Developer" or "react Developer". I can't imagine how can you be a good framework developer without knowing core principles of language that has been used to build it. I follow teaching style promoted by great Kyle Simpson who is a strong believer in deep understanding before moving forward. Francois-Xavier P. Darveau shares the same school. Great read!

## Front End Center

[https://frontend.center/](https://frontend.center/)

[Glen Maddern](https://twitter.com/glenmaddern) just started a new project called Front End Center. He released just one video so far but this single watch was totally enough to convince me to follow it and recommend it to you. The best explanation of Webpack that you can find. I'm looking forward to following screen casts by Glen.
