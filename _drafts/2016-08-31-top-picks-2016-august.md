## David Wells - CSS in React

A great talk by [David Wells](https://twitter.com/DavidWells) on ReactJS San Francisco Bay Area meet-up. All that you need to know about styling React components. Pros and cons of each popular method with strong recommendation of [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) powered by [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/). I don't entirely agree with some parts of David's approach but it is really interesting to have an overview of other developers strategy.
