- first review ever
- lots of cool things
- nice oprtunity to summarize myself
- good place to define 2017 resolutions

## Profesional

- best yesr for contribution

## Personal

- understood my problem with lack of balance in life, main focus to work on in 2017
- saving money for house and finally buy a first house
- relationship is too personal but this one could be better, related with lack of balance, no time for personal lifestyle
