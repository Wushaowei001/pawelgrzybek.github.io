I ditched Adobe products more than a year ago and [I don't miss it at all](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/). Affinity Photo is a tool that I replaced Photoshop with. It is not that complex, not that advanced, but interface is extremely similar and it does absolutely more than I need. The only downside of this tool was mac OS compatibility only. Today officially windows users can join the club. Happy days!
