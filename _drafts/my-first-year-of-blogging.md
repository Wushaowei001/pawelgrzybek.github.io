Web developer's learning curve is endless and the main source of information are blogs created by other developers. Vast majority of good developers highlight the benefits of written content whenever they share some thoughts about their career path. I have never understood before I tried that by myself. Exactly one year ago I published [my first article](https://pawelgrzybek.com/hello-there/) on this website and I can't be happier that I started. I won't stop here - sure thing! Let me share with you my thoughts about my first year of blogging.

TLTR: Create a blog, write one, publish one - now!

## Not so boring stats

There is no place for boring stats, simply because I have no access to any numbers. On very beginning I had a Google Analytics tracking script installed, but shortly after that I got rid of it. I decided to dedicate my time for writing a content instead of investigating a numbers of visitors. Till nowadays I have no clue how many people read my articles.

My domain costs me £9 annually and this is the only cost that I spent for my website. I earned on my website £0. I have never thought about my it as a source of income and I'm going to be stick to it.

I managed to publish 37 articles in total which gives in average portion of fresh content every 10 days. Compared to some other popular bloggers this score isn't impressive at all. Anyway, I'm really proud of work that I have done taking into consideration fact that I have a full time job (which is not related with my personal projects), run a small online business with my good friend who lives 2000km away, care about my lovely cat and recently went through split with my girlfriend after 4 years of relationship. Although I'd wish to write more, I can't promise you that.

## Jekyll, GitHub Pages and Cloudflare turned out as a fantastic setup

My research about technology that I wanted to use wasn't intense. I decided to use the same tools as majority of community is recommending in the age of static websites generators. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) supercharged by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) turned out as a great setup. If you want to find out more about my setup, [one of my first articles](https://pawelgrzybek.com/jekyll-blog-on-github-pages-supercharged-by-cloudflare/) goes in depth about the subject.

## What went well

The main benefit of blogging is definitely knowledge learned by writing. Every article requires a solid preparation and research. Taking care about quality of a content makes sense because payback will come shortly (not monetary). After very few articles I noticed that people share my articles with other web developers. Satisfaction of seeing your article exchanged by community is priceless. Some of my web gurus that I follow recommended my posts on social media channels. Some of them even follow me back of Twitter! Wawawiwa! People like Chris Coyier, Wes Bos, Rachel Andrew, Mattias P Johansson and Anselm Hannemann appreciated my effort and shared it on social media channels and periodic newsletters. Priceless! Thank you for your support guys!

## What are my future plans

Blog more. Learn more. Share more. Being involved in progress of amazing web comunity. The most importantly - I want to keep it fun!
